Experiments with context free grammars (CFG) and attempts to create a new language.

## Assumptions
- This is going to be a transpiler, that is, the code will be generated to pure `C` language.
- The goal is to create a simple but very usable language.
- The language is inspired by others like Rust, C, C++, Python, Go.
